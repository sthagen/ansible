bugfixes:
- Vault - Make the single vaulted value ``AnsibleVaultEncryptedUnicode`` class
  work more like a string by replicating the behavior of ``collections.UserString``
  from Python. These changes don't allow it to be considered a string, but
  most common python string actions will now work as expected.
