major_changes:
  - Plugin routing allows collections to declare deprecation, redirection targets, and removals for all plugin types.
  - Routing data built into Ansible 2.10 ensures that 2.9 content should work unmodified on 2.10. Formerly included
    modules and plugins that were moved to collections are still accessible by their original unqualified names, so long
    as their destination collections are installed.
  - Collections may declare a list of supported/tested Ansible versions for the collection. A warning is issued if a
    collection does not support the Ansible version that loads it (can also be configured as silent or a fatal error).
    Collections that do not declare supported Ansible versions do not issue a warning/error.
  - Plugins that import module_utils and other ansible namespaces that have moved to collections should
    continue to work unmodified.
